## Hi there 👋

I'm Onanefeoghene, my nickname or shorter name is Efe.
I'm a Data Scientist with a focus on ML Engineering.

I mostly work on Predictive Modelling, and I'm good with Statistics.
I'm currently working on LLMs, building RAGs, Agentic AI, and honing my PyTorch skills to be able to replicate papers.

I also use Django and Django REST frameworks to build APIs, and sometimes a mini web application.
