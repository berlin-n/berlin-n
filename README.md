## Hi there 👋

I'm Onanefeoghene, my nickname or shorter name is Efe.
I'm a Data Scientist with a focus on ML Engineering.

I mostly work on Predictive Modelling, and I'm good with Statistics.
I'm currently working on LLMs, building RAGs, and honing my PyTorch skills to replicate papers.

I also use Django and the Django REST framework to build APIs and sometimes mini web applications.

P.S. I'm really working on my documentation habits. I like to go a bit traditional, using Paper and Pen, it's generally good for brainstorming for me.
It's not sustainable, I know, but I will stick to it and improve my READMEs alongside.
